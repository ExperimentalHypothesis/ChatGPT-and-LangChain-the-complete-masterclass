This is a series of small miniproject around ChatGPT and langchain. It is based on the superior tutorial https://www.udemy.com/course/chatgpt-and-langchain-the-complete-developers-masterclass maybe sligthly tweak in order to match the current state/version of langachain.

Each miniproject has its own subfolder. They are all in one root for simplicity and also because they share common venv.

The purpose of this repo is solely educational. The working examples/project serves as reference and provide some usefull building blocks for bigger app. Occasionally I add comments to the code to make it super clear what is going on there.
